Client can be started by typing wbc379 hostname portnumber [keyfile].  Once launched, there is a menu to guide you.  The options presented are:

1 - Send query

This will query the whiteboard entry that you ask for.  You will have to input the entry number.  If the entry is encrypted, the client will try to decrypt it.  If there is no keyfile, or if the key is not found, you will be notified.

2 - Update a whiteboard entry without encryption

This is a plaintext entry.  Simply enter the message when prompted, and enter the whiteboard entry number you wish to update when prompted.

3 - Update a whiteboard entry with encryption

Same as above, but with an encrypted entry.  If there is no keyfile, you will be notified and no message will be sent to the server.

4 - Clean an entry

Wipe the whiteboard entry and entry number specified by you.

5 - Exit

Client will close the connection and quit.
